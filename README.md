# TIC_TAC_TOE_in_python
Task-2 at Internpe Internship !!

## Overview

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game can be played between two players on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend in a head-to-head match.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a grid position.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that players enter valid and unoccupied positions.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using Python.
2. Players will be prompted to enter their moves alternately by choosing a position on the 3x3 grid (positions are labeled from 1 to 9).
3. The game will automatically check for a winner after each move.
4. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VodnalaSrujana004/TIC_TAC_TOE_in_python.git
